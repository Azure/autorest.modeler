            Because a job schedule can have at most one active job under it at
            any given time, if it is time to create a new job under a job
            schedule, but the previous job is still running, the Batch service
            will not create the new job until the previous job finishes. If the
            previous job does not finish within the startWindow period of the
            new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be scheduled for that
            interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify a
            jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use
            jobManagerTask, you will need an external process to monitor when
            jobs are created, add tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready
            for the next recurrence. The default is that the schedule does not
            recur: one job is created, within the startWindow after the
            doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as soon as that job
            finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower
            value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you
            are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad
            Request).

            Both relative and absolute paths are supported. Relative paths are
            relative to the task working directory. The following wildcards are
            supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc*
            would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any
            single character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and
            [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can include a
            negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc]
            matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with
            "." it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it
            explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif
            will). A simple example: **\*.txt matches any file that does not
            start in '.' and ends with .txt in the task working directory or any
            subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can
            be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file
            named abc*). Note that both \ and / are treated as directory
            separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables
            (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the
            pattern being applied.

      The Job Manager task is automatically started when the job is created. The
      Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager task before any other
      tasks in the job. When shrinking a pool, the Batch service tries to
      preserve compute nodes where Job Manager tasks are running for as long as
      possible (that is, nodes running 'normal' tasks are removed before nodes
      running Job Manager tasks). When a Job Manager task fails and needs to be
      restarted, the system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If
      there are no idle nodes available, the system may terminate one of the
      running tasks in the pool and return it to the queue in order to make room
      for the Job Manager task to restart. Note that a Job Manager task in one
      job does not have priority over tasks in other jobs. Across jobs, only job
      level priorities are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority
      0 job needs to be restarted, it will not displace tasks of a priority 1
      job.

      You can use Job Preparation to prepare a compute node to run tasks for the
      job. Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include: Downloading
      common resource files used by all the tasks in the job. The Job
      Preparation task can download these common resource files to the shared
      location on the compute node. (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR\shared), or starting
      a local service on the compute node so that all tasks of that job can
      communicate with it. If the Job Preparation task fails (that is, exhausts
      its retry count before exiting with exit code 0), Batch will not run tasks
      of this job on the compute node. The node remains ineligible to run tasks
      of this job until it is reimaged. The node remains active and can be used
      for other jobs. The Job Preparation task can run multiple times on the
      same compute node. Therefore, you should write the Job Preparation task to
      handle re-execution. If the compute node is rebooted, the Job Preparation
      task is run again on the node before scheduling any other task of the job,
      if rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job Preparation task
      did not previously complete. If the compute node is reimaged, the Job

      The Job Release task runs when the job ends, because of one of the
      following: The user calls the Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API
      while the job is still active, the job's maximum wall clock time
      constraint is reached, and the job is still active, or the job's Job
      Manager task completed, and the job is configured to terminate when the
      Job Manager completes. The Job Release task runs on each compute node
      where tasks of the job have run and the Job Preparation task ran and
      completed. If you reimage a compute node after it has run the Job
      Preparation task, and the job ends without any further tasks of the job
      running on that compute node (and hence the Job Preparation task does not
      re-run), then the Job Release task does not run on that node. If a compute
      node reboots while the Job Release task is still running, the Job Release
      task runs again when the compute node starts up. The job is not marked as
      complete until all Job Release tasks have completed. The Job Release task
      runs in the background. It does not occupy a scheduling slot; that is, it
      does not count towards the maxTasksPerNode limit specified on the pool.

            The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as
            the Azure Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough
            free IP addresses to accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If
            the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the pool will
            partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize error will occur. The
            'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the 'Classic
            Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role
            for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow
            communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule
            tasks on the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the
            specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If
            communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied
            by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the compute
            nodes to unusable. For pools created with
            virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
            ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools
            created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual
            networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any associated
            Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must
            be enabled for inbound communication. For pools created with a
            virtual machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well
            as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For pools created
            with a cloud service configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and
            30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage on port
            443. For more details see:

            system and perform whatever actions are required for the job.) For

            parameter, analyze the contents of that file and submit additional
            tasks based on those contents.

            In general, the exit code for a process reflects the specific
            convention implemented by the application developer for that
            process. If you use the exit code value to make decisions in your
            code, be sure that you know the exit code convention used by the
            application process. However, if the Batch service terminates the
            subtask (due to timeout, or user termination via the API) you may
            see an operating system-defined exit code.

            completion behavior may not be changed from terminatejob to
            noaction. You may not change the value from terminatejob to noaction
            - that is, once you have engaged automatic job termination, you
            cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the request fails
            and Batch returns status code 400 (Bad Request) and an 'invalid
            property value' error response. If you do not specify this element
            in a PUT request, it is equivalent to passing noaction. This is an
            error if the current value is terminatejob.

          When you request that a pool be deleted, the following actions occur:
          the pool state is set to deleting; any ongoing resize operation on the
          pool are stopped; the Batch service starts resizing the pool to zero
          nodes; any tasks running on existing nodes are terminated and requeued
          (as if a resize pool operation had been requested with the default
          requeue option); finally, the pool is removed from the system. Because
          running tasks are requeued, the user can rerun these tasks by updating
          their job to target a different pool. The tasks can then run on the
          new pool. If you want to override the requeue behavior, then you
          should call resize pool explicitly to shrink the pool to zero size
          before deleting the pool. If you call an Update, Patch or Delete API
          on a pool in the deleting state, it will fail with HTTP status code
          409 with error code PoolBeingDeleted.

          You cannot enable automatic scaling on a pool if a resize operation is
          in progress on the pool. If automatic scaling of the pool is currently
          disabled, you must specify a valid autoscale formula as part of the
          request. If automatic scaling of the pool is already enabled, you may
          specify a new autoscale formula and/or a new evaluation interval. You
          cannot call this API for the same pool more than once every 30
          seconds.

          You can only resize a pool when its allocation state is steady. If the
          pool is already resizing, the request fails with status code 409. When
          you resize a pool, the pool's allocation state changes from steady to
          resizing. You cannot resize pools which are configured for automatic
          scaling. If you try to do this, the Batch service returns an error
          409. If you resize a pool downwards, the Batch service chooses which
          nodes to remove. To remove specific nodes, use the pool remove nodes
          API instead.

          This does not restore the pool to its previous state before the resize
          operation: it only stops any further changes being made, and the pool
          maintains its current state. After stopping, the pool stabilizes at
          the number of nodes it was at when the stop operation was done. During
          the stop operation, the pool allocation state changes first to
          stopping and then to steady. A resize operation need not be an
          explicit resize pool request; this API can also be used to halt the
          initial sizing of the pool when it is created.

          During an upgrade, the Batch service upgrades each compute node in the
          pool. When a compute node is chosen for upgrade, any tasks running on
          that node are removed from the node and returned to the queue to be
          rerun later (or on a different compute node). The node will be
          unavailable until the upgrade is complete. This operation results in
          temporarily reduced pool capacity as nodes are taken out of service to
          be upgraded. Although the Batch service tries to avoid upgrading all
          compute nodes at the same time, it does not guarantee to do this
          (particularly on small pools); therefore, the pool may be temporarily
          unavailable to run tasks. When this operation runs, the pool state
          changes to upgrading. When all compute nodes have finished upgrading,
          the pool state returns to active. While the upgrade is in progress,
          the pool's currentOSVersion reflects the OS version that nodes are
          upgrading from, and targetOSVersion reflects the OS version that nodes
          are upgrading to. Once the upgrade is complete, currentOSVersion is
          updated to reflect the OS version now running on all nodes. This
          operation can only be invoked on pools created with the
          cloudServiceConfiguration property.

          Deleting a job also deletes all tasks that are part of that job, and
          all job statistics. This also overrides the retention period for task
          data; that is, if the job contains tasks which are still retained on
          compute nodes, the Batch services deletes those tasks' working
          directories and all their contents.  When a Delete Job request is
          received, the Batch service sets the job to the deleting state. All
          update operations on a job that is in deleting state will fail with
          status code 409 (Conflict), with additional information indicating
          that the job is being deleted.

          The Batch Service immediately moves the job to the disabling state.
          Batch then uses the disableTasks parameter to determine what to do
          with the currently running tasks of the job. The job remains in the
          disabling state until the disable operation is completed and all tasks
          have been dealt with according to the disableTasks option; the job
          then moves to the disabled state. No new tasks are started under the
          job until it moves back to active state. If you try to disable a job
          that is in any state other than active, disabling, or disabled, the
          request fails with status code 409.

          When you call this API, the Batch service sets a disabled job to the
          enabling state. After the this operation is completed, the job moves
          to the active state, and scheduling of new tasks under the job
          resumes. The Batch service does not allow a task to remain in the
          active state for more than 7 days. Therefore, if you enable a job
          containing active tasks which were added more than 7 days ago, those
          tasks will not run.

          The Batch service supports two ways to control the work done as part
          of a job. In the first approach, the user specifies a Job Manager
          task. The Batch service launches this task when it is ready to start
          the job. The Job Manager task controls all other tasks that run under
          this job, by using the Task APIs. In the second approach, the user
          directly controls the execution of tasks under an active job, by using
          the Task APIs. Also note: when naming jobs, avoid including sensitive
          information such as user names or secret project names. This
          information may appear in telemetry logs accessible to Microsoft
          Support engineers.

          task. This includes nodes which have since been removed from the pool.

          Release task, the Batch service returns HTTP status code 409
          (Conflict) with an error code of JobPreparationTaskNotSpecified.

          Task counts provide a count of the tasks by active, running or
          completed task state, and a count of tasks which succeeded or failed.
          Tasks in the preparing state are counted as running. If the
          validationStatus is unvalidated, then the Batch service has not been
          able to check state counts against the task states as reported in the
          List Tasks API. The validationStatus may be unvalidated if the job
          contains more than 200,000 tasks.

          If you try to delete a certificate that is being used by a pool or
          compute node, the status of the certificate changes to deleteFailed.
          If you decide that you want to continue using the certificate, you can
          use this operation to set the status of the certificate back to
          active. If you intend to delete the certificate, you do not need to
          run this operation after the deletion failed. You must make sure that
          the certificate is not being used by any resources, and then you can
          try again to delete the certificate.

          You cannot delete a certificate if a resource (pool or compute node)
          is using it. Before you can delete a certificate, you must therefore
          make sure that the certificate is not associated with any existing
          pools, the certificate is not installed on any compute nodes (even if
          you remove a certificate from a pool, it is not removed from existing
          compute nodes in that pool until they restart), and no running tasks
          depend on the certificate. If you try to delete a certificate that is
          in use, the deletion fails. The certificate status changes to
          deleteFailed. You can use Cancel Delete Certificate to set the status
          back to active if you decide that you want to continue using the
          certificate.

          When you delete a job schedule, this also deletes all jobs and tasks
          under that schedule. When tasks are deleted, all the files in their
          working directories on the compute nodes are also deleted (the
          retention period is ignored). The job schedule statistics are no
          longer accessible once the job schedule is deleted, though they are
          still counted towards account lifetime statistics.

          request. For example, if the schedule property is not specified with
          this request, then the Batch service will keep the existing schedule.
          Changes to a job schedule only impact jobs created by the schedule
          after the update has taken place; currently running jobs are

          Note that each task must have a unique ID. The Batch service may not
          return the results for each task in the same order the tasks were
          submitted in this request. If the server times out or the connection
          is closed during the request, the request may have been partially or
          fully processed, or not at all. In such cases, the user should
          re-issue the request. Note that it is up to the user to correctly
          handle failures when re-issuing a request. For example, you should use
          the same task IDs during a retry so that if the prior operation
          succeeded, the retry will not create extra tasks unexpectedly. If the
          response contains any tasks which failed to add, a client can retry
          the request. In a retry, it is most efficient to resubmit only tasks
          that failed to add, and to omit tasks that were successfully added on
          the first attempt. The maximum lifetime of a task from addition to
          completion is 7 days. If a task has not completed within 7 days of
          being added it will be terminated by the Batch service and left in
          whatever state it was in at that time.

          When a task is deleted, all of the files in its directory on the
          compute node where it ran are also deleted (regardless of the
          retention time). For multi-instance tasks, the delete task operation
          applies synchronously to the primary task; subtasks and their files
          are then deleted asynchronously in the background.

          For multi-instance tasks, the terminate task operation applies
          synchronously to the primary task; subtasks are then terminated
          asynchronously in the background.

          Reactivation makes a task eligible to be retried again up to its

          task is no longer in the completed state, any previous exit code or
          failure information is no longer available after reactivation. Each
          time a task is reactivated, its retry count is reset to 0.
          Reactivation will fail for tasks that are not completed or that
          previously completed successfully (with an exit code of 0).
          Additionally, it will fail if the job has completed (or is terminating
